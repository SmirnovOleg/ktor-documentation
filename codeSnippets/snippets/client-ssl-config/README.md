# Client SSL config

A sample Ktor project showing how to configure SSL settings for different [engines](https://ktor.io/docs/http-client-engines.html).
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

Before running this client sample, you need to create a certificate and run the [ssl-engine-main](../ssl-engine-main) example:

1. Create a keystore by executing the following command in a repository's root directory:
   ```Bash
   keytool -keystore snippets/ssl-engine-main/keystore.jks -alias sampleAlias -genkeypair -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 3 -dname 'CN=localhost, OU=ktor, O=ktor, L=Unspecified, ST=Unspecified, C=US' -ext 'SAN:c=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1'
   ```

   Enter `foobar` as a password.

2. Start a server from the [ssl-engine-main](../ssl-engine-main) example:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :ssl-engine-main:run
   ```

3. Copy the keystore created in the first step to the client sample:
   ```Bash
   cp snippets/ssl-engine-main/keystore.jks snippets/client-ssl-config/keystore.jks
   ```

4. Run this client sample to make a request and get a response:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :client-ssl-config:run
   ```
